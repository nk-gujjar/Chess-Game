# Chess-Coding-Adventure
Version 2.0 of the Coding Adventure Bot. Good at beating up humans (~2600 on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/CodingAdventureBot/playing)), but still has a very long way to go against its fellow machines (Stockfish crushes it even with rook-odds!)


Note: this is the UCI version of the program, which does not have a graphical interface. The UCI implementation is also very barebones -- I just did the minimum to get it up and running on lichess.
